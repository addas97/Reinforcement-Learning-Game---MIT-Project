# Reinforcement-Learning-Game - MIT-Project
The project seeks to learn the optimal control policies for a text-based game using reinforcement learning. The interactions between players and the virtual environment are dictated through text.

Special thanks to the MIT 6.86 course leaders for writing some of this code base.
